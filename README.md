# Pokedeck

Christmas 2023, I think it is time for Pokemon to enter the chat.

My six year old, J, got the training pokemon set for christmas and we played it about eight times in 48 hours and my nostalgia induced dopamine levels hit the roof.

Fast forward to new years day, and the opportunity to sift through some random pokemon cards I bought from ebay for this very occasion flooded my dopamine receptors once again, only to be pushed even higher by my brain asking if I could use R to help catalogue and progress ~my~ our new collection.

I used the TCGPlayer app to scan the cards and export them to csv.

I am hoping to use R to read in the collection, and hopefully some open source database of pokemon to tell us what cards are missing (we have some stage 1 and 2 pokemon that require some basic cards to evolve from) and what cards we could use (we have some basic cards that no doubt can be evolved).
